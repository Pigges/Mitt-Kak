Mitt Käk! is an app where you can order your own school lunch.
```

```
"Seeing so many pupils not eating the school food and all the food being thrown away was too much for me as a school food provider. Something I wanted to change. The solution was MittKäk, an app that lets students decide what they want to eat. They simply order from a menu for the coming week and then rate the food they have eaten. And the results for students, school, restaurant and the environment are clear - and better than we could ever have hoped for."

- Sofia Nordell, founder of Mitt Käk
